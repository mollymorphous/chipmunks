# Chipmunks

:chipmunk: Cute little inventory manager for groceries and household supplies

Chipmunks is a private, self-hosted web app to make managing your fridge,
pantry, or supply closet easy. It's currently in early development, but when
completed will include features like:

- Supply levels and predictive inventory: Set a desired amount of a supply,
  and Chipmunks will track your usage and let you know when it's time to
  resupply
- Shopping lists: Build shopping lists for different trips or stores together
  with your household and print them out or check things off on your phone
- Recipe management: Enter your favorite recipes and Chipmunks can show you
  what you can make with what you have in stock or add the missing ingredients
  to a shopping list
- Barcode scanner: Quickly check items in, out, or off your shopping list with
  your phone's camera

The namesake of this project, chipmunks, are small ground squirrels of the
subtribe _Tamiina_ which are famous for stockpiling food in their burrows.
